# 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis 

 **This report is part of the assesment for BIOC3301 Module at UCL**
  
  We analysied 16S rRNA  extracted from soil samples which were collected from Gordon Square Gardens, London. The data was processed using 	**QIIME** and [MicrobiomeAnalyst] (http://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca/) tools.
  
  A data set comprising the BIOM tables obtained from Project**SRP044877** - * *16s rRNA profiling of Park Grass microbial community* * was downloaded from [EBI Metagenomics] (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/projects/SRP044877) and compared to the BIOM tables resulted from the processing of the samples from Gordon Square Garden.
  
  The steps involved in the processing and analysis of the sequences are:
